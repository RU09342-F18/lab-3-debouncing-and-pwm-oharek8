# Summary of Header File
This file defines macros for the boards used in lab for the purpose of making my code more general.

# Using the header file
The header file must be included just as any other header file. However, the project must know where the header file is stored on your computer.
To create a path to your header file, click the Project tab at the top of CCS and select Properties. In the list to the left you will see
an tab called Include Options. From this menu you may add a new path for your project to the header file.
